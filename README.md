# Personnel tracking application
Hello everyone,
   The purpose of this project is to learn python, image manipulation, creating graphical user interface and real time image capture with opencv.

In this project,
- Haar cascade classifier was used for face recognition.
- tkinter and Customtkinter are used for the interface.
- Added faces are trained in train.yml



## Run it on your computer

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/4thAhmet/PersonelTakipGUI_FaceDetection
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd PersonelTakipGUI_FaceDetection
```

Gerekli paketleri y√ºkleyin

```bash
    pip install tk
    pip install customtkinter
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install pillow
    pip install numpy 
    Install the Aforge.Direct.Show package for camera use.
    Install version 4.11.3497 of Emgu.CV package to manipulate the image
```

Run the project.

```bash
  python Main.py or python3 Main.py
```




## What did I learn?

This project was done in the learning phase. With this project, I learned the Haar Cascade classifier and performed face recognition.
I learned to use the opencv library and to perform operations on the image.
I learned interface development with Custom tkinter, defining objects in the Interface and using their properties.
I made this project with Python
